# Numerical Solutions of Initial Value Problems

This project focuses on the theoretical understanding and practical implementation of three fundamental numerical methods for solving initial value problems (IVPs) using MATLAB. The methods include Euler, Taylor, and Runge-Kutta, each providing a unique approach to approximate solutions to differential equations.

## Methods Overview

### 1. Euler Method
A first-order numerical procedure used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. Despite its numerical instability for stiff equations, it's a valuable introductory tool for numerical analysis.

### 2. Taylor Method
An extension of the Euler method, the Taylor method provides higher-order accuracy by considering higher-order derivatives in the Taylor series expansion. Suitable for a wider range of ODEs, especially stiff equations.

### 3. Runge-Kutta Method
A higher-order numerical technique offering improved accuracy over the Euler method. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is particularly notable for balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.
